[[!meta title="Git merge policy: core developer"]]

All development should happen in topic branches. For a new feature XXX, it should
be named `feature/XXX`. For a bugfix about YYY, it should be name `bugfix/YYY`.
When the developer thinks it is good enough and has tested it, she must:

- merge the topic branch into the `experimental` one
- set the ticket's *QA Check* field to *Ready for QA*
- set the ticket's *Feature Branch* field
- set the ticket's *Target version* field to the release you would
  like your changes to be in
- ask the Release Managers to review and merge (in devel generally, in testing
  or stable for bugfixes) by writing to the `tails-dev@boum.org`
  mailing-list

Then, if the reviewer asks for more development to be done before
merging, they should set the ticket's *QA Check* field back to *Needs
more dev* or *Needs more info* state, and
from now on it's the responsibility of the branch/ticket "holder" to
change it back to *Ready for QA* once they consider the issues raised by
the reviewer are fixed.
