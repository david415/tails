# What?

debomatic.lizard runs the
[Deb-o-Matic](https://launchpad.net/debomatic) automatic build machine
for Debian source packages.

Supported distributions are:

* `stable` (i386)
* `squeeze-backports` (i386)
* `squeeze-backports-mozilla` (i386): Squeeze + squeeze-backports +
  mozilla.debian.net's squeeze-backport
* `unstable` (i386)
* `unstable-amd64` (amd64)

# How?

One has binary packages built by uploading a source package to
`/incoming/`, with dupload or dput, over scp.

The `Distribution:` field in the uploaded `.changes` file specifies
the distribution the source package must be built for.
The `changestool(1)` command, from [[!debpkg reprepro]], is very handy
to set this after building the source package locally, and before
uploading it to Deb-o-Matic.

Once binary packages are built:

* the `.changes` file must be signed
* resulting files can be copied from `debomatic.lizard:/incoming/` to
  `apt.lizard:/srv/reprepro/incoming/` e.g. by using `scp -3` on the
  host, and `debsign -r` from your local system.
