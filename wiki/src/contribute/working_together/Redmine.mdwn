Tails tasks are managed in a [[!tails_redmine "" desc="Redmine project"]].

If you need to do something in Redmine, but you appear to lack the
needed credentials, please ask <tails-sysadmins@boum.org> to give you
more power.

Some documentation about how we are using Redmine is available in the
[[contribute/working_together]] pages. See also the [[review and merge
process|contribute/merge_policy/review]] documentation.

Email commands
==============

Create a ticket by email
------------------------

You need to provide all the required fields in the body of the email, and the
syntax is case sensitive. For example this works:

    To: redmine@labs.riseup.net
    Subject: Test creating a ticket by email

        Project: tails
        Tracker: Feature
        Status: Confirmed
        Priority: Low
        Type of work: Test

        It should be possible to create a ticket by sending an email to Redmine.

If you send attachments with your email they will also be attached to the
ticket. For example your OpenPGP signature :)

Updating a ticket by email
--------------------------

An easy trick is to reply to an email notification about that ticket. Then only
include in the body of the email the fields that you want to change, and a
description for your changes. For example:

    To: redmine@labs.riseup.net
    Subject: Re: [Tails - Feature #6813] (Confirmed) Test creating a ticket by email

        Status: Resolved

        This works but Redmine is quite picky on the syntax...
