# Ways to donate

We currently accept donations via:

  * A crowdfunding campaign run by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/)
  * [[Bitcoin|donate#bitcoin]]
  * In the future, we might be able to accept other kinds of
    donations:  Paypal, wire or bank transfer... In the meantime, if
    you cannot donate through Bitcoin, please [direct your donations
    to the Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/donate/) -- they do
    great work, and they support us financially.
