Schedule
========

This is a very preliminary schedule. If there's something else you
would like to see happen during the HackFest: talk to us.

Talks
-----

* **Introductory talk**
* **Triaging Tails tickets**, by BitingBird: an easy way to start contributing and learn what are the plans
* **Enforcing Anonymity and Improving Pseudonymity in Tails**, by
  David Wolinsky from the Decentralized and Distributed Systems
  Research group at Yale
* **Automated testing of Tails**: introduction, demonstration of
  running the tests, demonstration of writing a new testcase, known
  issues, future plans

Workshops
---------

* **Deciphering the process of contributing to Tails**, by DrWhax & u: There are lots of ways to contribute : helping with user support, writing documentation, translating, proof reading, web programming, testing ISOs, reporting bugs, triaging bugs, auditing code, writing code, contributing back to Debian for software used in Tails, doing system administration, advocating Tails, formulating ideas on further improvements and more.
* **Contributing to Tails by working on Debian**: sometimes, the best
  way to help Tails is to make Debian better; let's see how
* **Improving the infrastructure behind Tails**: getting started with
  Tails system administration
* **Translate Tails**, by u & others: hands-on translations: how to set up a working environment to improve Tails in your language, it's easier than it sounds.

Discussions
-----------

* **Inserting a layer of virtualization into Tails**, as a follow-up
  to David Wolinsky's talk. Let's think together about it, evaluate
  what compromises are acceptable, and come up with good ideas.

And much more!
--------------

Most of the discussions and hands-on hacking that will happen there
are deliciously unscheduled! :)
