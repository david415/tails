[[!meta title="Revamp the Greeter UI"]]

**Ticket**: [[!tails_ticket 5464 desc="#5464"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

tails-greeter works fine, and its code in not that bad anymore, so on
this side it's now feasible to add features (e.g. [[!tails_ticket
5421]], [[!tails_ticket 5479]]).

However, the greeter UI is difficult to use, and adding more options
in the current state of things would only make things worse
usability-wise.

So, we have to improve the greeter UI to make it more ergonomic and
easier to use.

Current proposal
================

After working on a prototype and do UX testing with Numa people, we arrived to
the proposal described here.
