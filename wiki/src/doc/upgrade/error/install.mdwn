The upgrade could not be installed.

<div class="caution">

report:

   - the debugging information that appears in the error message
   - the output of the five following commands, run in a
    [[<span class=\"application\">Terminal</span>|first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#terminal]]:

        mount
