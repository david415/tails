[[!meta title="Error while checking for upgrades"]]

Tails could not determine whether an upgrade is available from our website.

This is probably caused by a network connection problem.

Check your network connection, and restart Tails to check for upgrades again.

If the problem persists, [[report an error|support]] and include
in your report the debugging information that appears in the error message.

This error could also be caused by:

  - an error in Tails Upgrader
  - a failure or an attack on the Tor exit node being used, your Internet
    service provider, or our website.

Sending us a report is the best way to further analyse the error.
