[[!meta title="Graphics"]]

Tails includes several applications for image manipulation, graphic design, and
page layout.

  - [The GIMP](http://gimp.org) for The GNU Image Manipulation Program for
    bitmap graphics. GIMP lets you draw, paint, edit images, and much more.
  - For vector-based drawing, [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org).
  - [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net) is an Open Source Desktop Page Layout. It
    can be used for many tasks; from booklets design to newspapers, magazines,
    newsletters and posters to technical documentation. It has sophisticated
    page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text and/or
    images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons, precision
    placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors. The Scribus
    document file format is XML-based. Unlike proprietary binary file formats,
    even damaged documents can be recovered with a simple text editor.

Those applications can be started from the
