Tails includes several applications for image manipulation, graphic design, and
page layout.

Tails includes [The GIMP](http://gimp.org) for The GNU Image Manipulation Program for
bitmap graphics. GIMP lets you draw, paint, edit images, and much more.

For vector-based drawing, Tails includes [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org).

[Scribus](http://www.scribus.net) is an Open Source Desktop Page Layout accessible from
the *Applications*&nbsp;▸ *Graphics*. It can be used for many tasks; from booklets
design to newspapers, magazines, newsletters and posters to technical
documentation. It has sophisticated page layout features like precision placing
and rotating of text and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier
curves polygons, precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK
custom colors. The Scribus document file format is XML-based. Unlike
proprietary binary file formats, even damaged documents can be recovered with
a simple text editor.

Both are accessible from *Applications*&nbsp;▸ *Graphics* menu.
