<div class="caution">

<strong>It is unsafe to write confidential text in a web
browser</strong> since JavaScript attacks can access it from inside
the browser. You should rather write your text in a separate
application, encrypt it using <span class="application">Tails OpenPGP
Applet</span>, and paste the encrypted text in your browser, before
sending it by email for example.
