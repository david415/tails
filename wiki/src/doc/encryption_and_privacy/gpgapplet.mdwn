With <span class="application">Tails OpenPGP Applet</span> you can:

  - [[Encrypt text with a passphrase|encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/passphrase_encryption]]
  - [[Encrypt and sign text with a public key|encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography]]
  - [[Decrypt and verify text|encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/decrypt_verify]]

Note that the applet doesn't manage your keys, that is done by Seahorse.
