[[!meta title="Network configuration"]]

Depending on your Internet connection, you might need to configure the way Tor
connects to the Internet. For example:

- If you need to use a proxy to access the Internet.
- If your Internet connection goes through a firewall that only allows
  connections to certain ports.
- If you want to use Tor bridges because your Internet connection is censored or
  you want to hide the fact that you are using Tor. See also our documentation
  on [[what are bridges and when to use them|bridge_mode]].

In these cases, choose to configure bridge, firewall, or proxy settings from
[[<span class="application">Tails
Greeter</span>|startup_options#tails_greeter]]:

1. When <span class="application">Tails Greeter</span> appears, in the
   <span class="guilabel">Welcome to Tails</span> window, click on the
   <span class="button">Yes</span> button. Then click on the
   <span class="button">Forward</span> button.

2. In the <span class="guilabel">Network configuration</span> section, select
   the following option: <span class="guilabel">This computer's Internet
   connection is censored, filtered, or proxied.</span>

Then, after starting the working session and connecting to the Internet, an
assistant will guide you through the configuration of Tor.
