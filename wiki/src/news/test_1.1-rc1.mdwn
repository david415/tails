# Known issues in 1.1~rc1

* If upgrading from 1.1~beta1, any existing persistent partition will
  be broken in 1.1~rc1. In fact, Tails Greeter may freeze when trying
  to enable a persistent partition created before 1.1~rc1.

* Does not start in some virtualization environments, such as such as
  QEMU 0.11.1 and VirtualBox 4.2. This can be corrected by upgrading
  to QEMU 1.0 or VirtualBox 4.3, or newer ([[!tails_ticket 7232]]).
