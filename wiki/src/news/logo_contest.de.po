"  - An image with an approximate 1:1 ratio, like the [onion\n"
"    logo](https://media.torproject.org/image/www-images/onion.jpg).\n"
"  - Plus the same image along with the \"Tails\" word either:\n"
"    - merged with the image as in the [Tor\n"
"      logo](https://media.torproject.org/image/www-images/tor-logo.jpg);\n"
"    - on the side of the image.\n"
"  - The \"Tails\" name must be spelled with an uppercase \"T\" only, and\n"
"    lowercase \"ails\".\n"
"  - The image should convey the ideas behind Tails: secrecy, privacy,\n"
"    anonymity, mystery, simplicity (Tails is ready-to-use).\n"
"  - The logo has to be a bit serious, but not sad.\n"
"  - Until now we reuse the colors from Tor (green and purple), but this can be\n"
"    changed.\n"
"  - We cannot reuse directly the Tor or Debian logo, but evoking it is ok (use\n"
"    Tor colors, or evoking the Debian swirl).\n"
"  - The image should be suited to print on nice stickers that people\n"
"    want to have on their computers, and on t-shirts that people are\n"
"    happy to wear.\n"
"  - Make sure that the fonts that you use are compatible with GPL3+. To be on\n"
"    the safe side, use [fonts available in Debian\n"
"    main](http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/debian-font-review.html),\n"
"    otherwise we will ask you to prove their compatibility with GPL3+.\n"
